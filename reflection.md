What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a hard time figuring out what the ultimate goal is for this assignment. I was still understanding the general idea of object oriented programming, and even though we learned about the bigger ideas and some examples in class, I felt like I didn't know what we were supposed to attack first and how I was going to attack it. I took CSC110 but I was not familiar with the terms such as "class" and "self" which was used as if we all knew well, which made it confusing for me. 

Once I understood the whole point of dividing the procedural_ file into the computer side and the resale_shop side, my goals became clearer and I was able to work through it more smoothly. Testing in the bottom part of main with the orders was difficult to figure out, but once I tried out some buying and selling, I understood how the functions were called.

I was struggling a lot with what modifications are needed in the main file when accessing certain items in the other items. 

For someone taking the course, I think it is helpful to have someone who understands python and the object oriented programming that will explain how it works step by step, even when you are very confused.
